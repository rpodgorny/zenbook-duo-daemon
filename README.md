1. Sent as the wired vendor feature report over the Bluetooth hidraw node, see `src/hidraw.rs`
2. Sent the same way as the backlight, see `src/hidraw.rs`
3. This key combination only works for GTK apps in GNOME.

## Installation

```bash
# Upgrade or install the latest release from GitHub
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PegasisForever/zenbook-duo-daemon/refs/heads/master/install.sh | sudo bash -s install

# Uninstall
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PegasisForever/zenbook-duo-daemon/refs/heads/master/install.sh | sudo bash -s uninstall

# Check logs
systemctl status zenbook-duo-daemon
```

The install script will:

1. Download the latest release from GitHub and install it to `/opt/zenbook-duo-daemon`.
2. Create a systemd service file in `/etc/systemd/system/zenbook-duo-daemon.service`
3. Create a backup of the old config file if it is not compatible with the new config file.
4. Enable and start the service

## Configuration

By default, the config file is located at `/etc/zenbook-duo-daemon/config.toml`. You can edit the fn lock, idle timeout, key mappings and keyboard VID:PID in the config file. The instructions are provided in the config file.

## Control Pipe

The daemon creates a named pipe for receiving commands at `/tmp/zenbook-duo-daemon.pipe` by default (configurable via `pipe_path` in the config file). The pipe is accessible by all users.

Send commands using echo example:

```bash
echo mic_mute_led_toggle > /tmp/zenbook-duo-daemon.pipe
```

Available commands:

| Command                    | Description                               |
| -------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| `mic_mute_led_toggle`      | Toggle microphone mute LED                |
| `mic_mute_led_on`          | Turn on microphone mute LED               |
| `mic_mute_led_off`         | Turn off microphone mute LED              |
| `backlight_toggle`         | Cycle keyboard backlight                  |
| `backlight_off`            | Turn off keyboard backlight               |
| `backlight_low`            | Set keyboard backlight to low             |
| `backlight_medium`         | Set keyboard backlight to medium          |
| `backlight_high`           | Set keyboard backlight to high            |
| `secondary_display_toggle` | Toggle secondary display                  |
| `secondary_display_on`     | Turn on secondary display                 |
| `secondary_display_off`    | Turn off secondary display                |
| `suspend_start`            | Signal suspend start (disables backlight) |
| `suspend_end`              | Signal suspend end (restores backlight)   |

Notes:

1. The `suspend_start` and `suspend_end` commands are sent automatically by the systemd services `zenbook-duo-daemon-pre-sleep` and `zenbook-duo-daemon-post-sleep` to disable keyboard backlight during suspend.
2. The secondary display commands are no-op when the keyboard is attached.
